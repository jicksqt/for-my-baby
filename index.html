To Joanna, My Baby I love you and always will be.
You'll be safe in my romance, babe, uh
Label's fading but
I see you cravin' for more
You're denying it
But you ain't controlling your actions
Keep me guessing but
Don't keep me waiting for us
Oh, I live to appreciate you
Take all the love that I give
All that I wish is for you to take me
But I taste the lies on your lips
I count the days when we're in love
'Cause I only matter when he's not around
Oh, but I live to appreciate you
Take all the love that I give, mhm
Got my heart on my sleeve
I'm beggin' the heavens to be good to me
Are you obsessive love?
'Cause I'm tolerating all of your desires
I'll keep you wanting me more, ooh
Leave but I'll keep you comin'
I'm sure it's my love that got you suffocated
Oh, I live to appreciate you
Take all the love that I give
All that I wish is for you to take me
But I taste the lies on your lips
I count the days when we're in love
'Cause I only matter when he's not around
Oh, but I live to appreciate you
Take all the love that I give, mhm
Oh, ooh, mmh, ohh
Oh, ooh, mmh, ohh
Take all the love that I give
All that I
You come over but not too often
You don't visit 'cause you got more options
You come over but not too often
You don't visit 'cause you got more options
Oh, ooh, mmh, ohh
Oh, ooh, mmh, ohh

You hesitate when you're hurtin', hmm-mmm
And you get too fake and uncertain, no, no
I knew you wouldn't save me if I'm fallin' in love, yeah
But if you would want affection, baby, come to my heart, oh-oh
Know that you could stay a little while, baby
Hope I could make you feel alive, yeah
So. open up your heart to me
Open up your heart to me
Now, open up your heart to me
Open up your heart to me, hey
You hesitate when you're hurtin', yeah, yeah
And you get too fake and uncertain
I knew you wouldn't save me if I'm fallin' in love
But if you would want affection, baby, come to my heart, oh, no
I think I finally found me a keeper
God picked her from my dreams, I'm a deep sleeper
Counting sheep out in the field, kick it with her on my team
Chase dreams, she's a goalkeeper
Momma said, "Ain't no reason to be nervous
Ain't a woman ever made perfect"
But I wasn't sure about you, certain allure about you
Found all your flaws were my flaws too
I found myself a little way too close to the edge
A little way too comfy in your bed
Homie told me, if I fell for this girl, I'd be dead
So, I told him I'll be buried with this woman that I'll marry
Who'd have thought it was all in my head
Who'd have thought it was all in my head
Didn't realize I fell 'til I hit the ground
Still hear the sound of my phone screen shatter in the background
So, open up your heart to me
Open up your heart to me
Open up your heart to me
Open up your heart to me, baby
Now, open up your heart to me
Open up your heart to me
Open up your heart to me
Open up your heart to me
You know you're my favorite vice
You're the one I want when I am stressing, hmm-mmm
Oh, that kiss was so precise
Got me begging in my mind, undress, babe

"Take all the love that I give because you're my favorite vice.
So open up your heart to me.
Cause I live to appreciate you.
I'm sure my love is suffocating, but
I finally found me a keeper." - Graniel
